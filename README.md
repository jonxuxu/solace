# Solace

A project to carve a space of mindfulness and meditation on the internet.


A real-time space to enjoy meaningful poems with strangers. Sit down, relax, and enjoy the music and the words.


Crafted with care by [Howard](https://github.com/Plasma-Vortex) and [Jonathan](https://github.com/JonathanXu1).
